                  <p>
                    Allison's engaging personality and passion for working with children and their families creates a positive environment for children to achieve success in speech and language. She is driven by a desire to instill confidence and ensure that all children communicate to the best of their ability. Allison believes that open communication with parents, teachers, medical professionals and physical and occupational therapists is crucial to achieving success in the areas of speech and language.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Allison evaluates and treats children ranging from age 18 months to 14 years in the areas of articulation disorders, phonological disorders, expressive and receptive language disorders, developmental delays, fluency (i.e., stuttering), resonance disorders (e.g., velopharyngeal insufficiency) and autism spectrum disorders.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Most recently, Allison has worked with a nonprofit organization in several educational settings providing speech and language intervention for children who have psychological and significant disabilities. In this role, she has had the opportunity to work directly with students and their educational and therapy teams to ensure that goals are functional and attainable.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Previous experience includes serving as the speech-language pathologist at Mt. Pleasant Elementary School in Mt. Pleasant, North Carolina. In this capacity, Allison provided therapy in individual and small-group settings and frequently pushed-in to the classroom to assess generalization of skills learned in the therapy setting. She continuously collaborated with parents and professionals to ensure appropriate provision of services. Allison utilized the Response to Intervention model in order to differentiate between delay and disorder.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Allison's additional clinical experiences included the provision of speech, language & feeding and swallowing evaluation and treatment at SUNY Upstate Medical University Hospital, the Syracuse Veterans Administration Medical Center and the Gebbie Speech-Language-Hearing Clinics. Allison re-discovered her love for working with children during her time at the North Syracuse Early Education Program where she served preschoolers with speech and language delay and autism spectrum disorders.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Allison earned a Master of Science in Speech-Language Pathology from Syracuse University. Prior to her Master's program, Allison attended North Carolina State University and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Communication with a concentration in Communication Disorders. She graduated Cum Laude and earned honors from the Department of Communication based on her research and resulting thesis "Recognition and intervention of language disorders in children: perceived roles of parents, teachers, pediatricians and the speech-language pathologist." As a John T. Caldwell Fellow, Allison had the opportunity to travel to London where she met with researchers regarding Specific Language Impairment and phonemic awareness in children, and spent time in Bosnia working with an after-school organization created to provide support for children with special needs and their families.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Allison resides in Cambridge and likes to learn more about the history of and explore the Boston area. She enjoys music, cooking, traveling to visit family in North Carolina and is happy ACC athletics are now televised in New England so she can watch and cheer for her beloved NC State Wolfpack.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Chatterboxes is grateful to count Allison as an accomplished team member. Allison's engaging personality and passion for working with children and their families creates a positive environment for children to achieve success.
