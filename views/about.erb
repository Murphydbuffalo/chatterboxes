										Heather's energetic and creative personality creates a positive environment for her patients to learn and achieve their goals. Heather establishes connections with her patients with ease, and tailors therapy sessions to each patient's individual needs and interests. Maintaining open communication with team members (parents, teachers, occupational therapists, physical therapists, etc.) is one of Heather's priorities. Heather believes that for a child to be successful and reach their speech and language goals, all team members must work together and communicate on an on-going basis. Heather goes the extra mile, diligently creating home programs and ensuring that goals and reports are comprehensible to all team members. Heather believes that constant practice and generalization of skills is an integral part of the therapy process and a child's success. Through the implementation of play-based therapy and a multimodality approach, Heather strives for her patients to be successful in reaching their optimal potentials.
