                  <p>
                    Occupational therapy is all about living life the fullest, whatever life looks like for you! For Rebekah, this means helping kids, young and old, to accomplish the little things in their everyday life and the big dreams yet to come. Whether it’s helping someone learn to tie his shoes all by himself or assisting someone to learn to feed herself, occupational therapy can benefit everyone!
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Rebekah’s fun personality and sweet disposition are key factors to her success in working with families and their littlest members to reach those goals. Her experience ranges from working with young children in a feeding and sensory based clinic as well as working in a more acute setting at a local hospital. As an occupational therapist, she specializes in pediatric feeding therapy, fine motor and gross motor development, activities of daily living, attention and behaviors and sensory processing. Her love for working in pediatrics started in high school when she was looking for somewhere to volunteer and stumbled upon a hippotherapy clinic (an occupational therapy clinic that uses horses to assist in carrying out goals). “As soon as I saw the huge smiles on the kids’ faces as they rode their horses, I knew that working with kids to make those smiles happen is something I wanted to do for the rest of my life.”
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    While she’s not saving the world as an occupational therapist, she enjoys hiking with her husband, exploring East Coast beaches, paddle boarding on the Charles, and training for 10Ks and half-marathons. She currently lives in Somerville with her husband.
                  </p>
